# Hacker News Front Page using GraphQL

In this project, I make use of Ruan Martinelli's Hacker News Graphql API.

## Steps
- Click [here](https://github.com/ruanmartinelli/hacker-news-graphql-api) to download the API server. Follow the instructions in the README file to get it running.
-  Step into this repo's directory
    `cd hacker-news-with-graphql`
- Start up server with [[python](https://www.python.org/)
    `python -m SimpleHTTP Server`
- Open the port on your browser
